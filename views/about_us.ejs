    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small
        to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what
        humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and
        yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? -
        Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your
        father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A
        perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow!
        That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey,
        Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it.
        Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a
        day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache?
        Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows,
        sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out
        of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations.
